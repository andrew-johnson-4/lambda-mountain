### Security

LM is fundamentally an assembler, permitting you to generate any target object that you want without significant restriction.
We strongly encourage static analysis to make sure that you get what you want from your program.
Beyond static analysis, LM aims to provide intuitive abstractions that transparently generate the program code that you are looking for.

The LM project itself however will only accept security vulnerabilities when "the generated code is surprising."
This could be in the nature of overly complex abstractions, strange interactions, or plain old bugs.
We welcome all security related communications publicly or privately at your discretion.

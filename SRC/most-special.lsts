# specialization does not always choose the lowest on the subsumption hierarchy
# for example: x -> x <: A -> A
# but for specialization we choose: A -> A
# This is because specialization chooses the most specific covariant,covariant domain,range pair
# This is different than the traditional contravariant,covariant unification for arrows
# Theoretically this is justified by flow-of-information during disambiguation
#    f(x) is interpreted as "f informed by x"
#    rather than as simply "f of x"
